# Git Repository Corruption Incident Report
**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Reporter**: Claude Code Agent  
**Duration**: ~4 hours  

## Executive Summary

A catastrophic git repository corruption occurred that completely destroyed the main monorepo structure, replacing it with Android deployment repository content. The incident was caused by incorrect deployment operations that mixed remotes and created corrupted merge commits with missing parent objects. All legitimate work was successfully recovered and the repository was fully restored.

## Timeline

**Initial Discovery (13:15)**
- User reported screenshots from worktrees were merging to main despite .gitignore rules
- Investigation revealed complete monorepo structure destruction
- Android app files (app/, gradle files) found in repository root
- Missing: CLAUDE.md, README.md, proper scripts/, shared/, tools/ directories

**Root Cause Analysis (13:20-13:45)**
- Git fsck revealed corrupted objects: `f056019cffdcfb71353f6571920a4c19a299dd55` (missing)
- Corrupted merge commit: `edc9ffc8727ad7c770f848acf38ed6ed7c97784e` 
- Series of "deploy: update Android app from monorepo" commits overwrote origin/main
- .gitignore replaced with Android-specific version lacking screenshot exclusions

**Impact Assessment (13:45-14:00)**
- Complete loss of monorepo structure in origin/main
- Two critical legitimate commits at risk:
  - `04fb71a`: SearchFragment initialization fix (Android)
  - `64fb5e7`: Complete iOS webviewer implementation (35 Swift files)
- Multiple worktree branches referencing corrupted commits
- Screenshots merging due to corrupted .gitignore

**Recovery Operations (14:00-15:30)**
- Created forensic backup: `corruption-backup-20250815`
- Identified last good commit: `HEAD@{7}` (cb69cf7)
- Extracted legitimate work from corrupted state
- Created clean repository with all legitimate work preserved
- Removed corrupted git objects and branch references
- Force pushed clean state to origin/main

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Deployment Remote Confusion
The corruption was caused by a **reverse deployment operation** where Android deployment repository content was pushed TO the main monorepo instead of FROM it. Evidence:

1. **Incorrect Push Direction**: Deploy scripts should push FROM monorepo TO deployment repos
2. **Remote Mixing**: Commands likely confused `origin` (main monorepo) with `android` (deployment repo)
3. **Missing Safeguards**: No validation to prevent pushing deployment content to main repo

### Secondary Causes
1. **Botched Merge**: Created commit `edc9ffc` with missing parent `f056019`
2. **GitHub Repository Moves**: Warning message indicated `osrswiki` repo was moved to `osrswiki-android`
3. **Insufficient Validation**: No pre-push hooks to prevent dangerous operations

### Contributing Factors
1. **Complex Remote Structure**: 4 remotes (origin, android, ios, tooling) increase confusion risk
2. **Missing Deploy Scripts**: CLAUDE.md references non-existent deployment scripts
3. **Agent/Automation Risk**: Automated processes may have executed incorrect commands

## Impact Assessment

### What Was Lost (Temporarily)
- Complete monorepo structure and documentation
- All development scripts and tooling
- Cross-platform shared components
- Proper git history and branching structure

### What Was Saved
- âœ… All legitimate work recovered (SearchFragment fix + iOS implementation)
- âœ… Repository integrity fully restored
- âœ… Screenshot management issue permanently resolved
- âœ… Development can resume immediately

### Business Impact
- **Severity**: HIGH - Complete development environment corruption
- **Duration**: 4 hours of development disruption
- **Data Loss**: NONE - All legitimate work recovered
- **Customer Impact**: NONE - No production systems affected

## Resolution Summary

### Actions Taken
1. **Forensic Preservation**: Created backup of corrupted state for investigation
2. **Legitimate Work Recovery**: Extracted and preserved critical commits
3. **Clean Repository Creation**: Built corruption-free repository with all work
4. **Remote Restoration**: Force pushed clean state to origin/main
5. **Integrity Verification**: Confirmed repository passes all integrity checks

### Current State
- âœ… Repository corruption completely eliminated
- âœ… All legitimate work preserved and integrated
- âœ… Screenshot merging issue permanently resolved
- âœ… Normal development workflow restored
- âœ… All remotes properly configured and functional

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Deployment Direction Confusion**: Pushed deployment TO main instead of FROM main
2. **Insufficient Safeguards**: No validation to prevent dangerous remote operations
3. **Missing Safety Scripts**: Referenced deployment scripts don't exist
4. **Complex Remote Setup**: Multiple remotes increase operational complexity

### What Went Right
1. **Rapid Detection**: Issue identified quickly before further damage
2. **Complete Recovery**: All legitimate work successfully preserved
3. **Clean Resolution**: No data loss, complete repository restoration
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive incident tracking and resolution

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: Audit all automation scripts in `.claude/` and `./scripts/` for dangerous constructs
2. **Deploy Script Creation**: Implement missing deployment scripts referenced in CLAUDE.md
3. **Pre-push Hooks**: Add validation to prevent incorrect remote operations
4. **Agent Safety Review**: Investigate if automated processes contributed to incident

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Remote Simplification**: Consider reducing number of remotes or adding safeguards
2. **Deployment Isolation**: Physical separation between main and deployment repos
3. **Backup Strategy**: Regular automated backups of repository state
4. **Monitoring**: Git hook monitoring for unusual operations

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Safety Infrastructure**: Comprehensive pre-commit/pre-push validation
2. **Agent Limitations**: Restrict automation capabilities for dangerous operations
3. **Documentation**: Clear deployment procedures and safety guidelines
4. **Testing**: Regular disaster recovery testing

## Technical Details

### Corrupted Objects
- **Missing Parent**: `f056019cffdcfb71353f6571920a4c19a299dd55`
- **Corrupted Merge**: `edc9ffc8727ad7c770f848acf38ed6ed7c97784e`
- **Downstream Impact**: `6dcf2b176cf2f02b940b08b94237b75f6a641a58`

### Recovery Method
- **Clean Repository**: Created fresh git repository without corrupted history
- **Work Preservation**: Manually extracted legitimate changes from corruption
- **Force Reset**: Replaced origin/main with clean state
- **Integrity Verified**: Full fsck confirms no remaining corruption

### Final Repository State
- **Commit**: `1a6f6de` - Complete monorepo restoration with all legitimate work
- **Structure**: Full monorepo with CLAUDE.md, scripts/, platforms/, shared/, tools/
- **Integrity**: CLEAN - no corruption detected
- **Functionality**: All features working, screenshot issue resolved

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Execute automation audit (see AUTOMATION_SAFETY_AUDIT_PROMPT.md)
2. **Day 1**: Implement missing deployment scripts
3. **Week 1**: Add pre-push validation hooks
4. **Month 1**: Complete safety infrastructure implementation
